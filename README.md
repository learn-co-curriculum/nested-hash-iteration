## Iterating Over Nested Hashes

At this point you should be familiar with iterating over hashes that have one
level &mdash; a series of key/value pairs on a single tier. For example:

```ruby
jon_snow = {
  name: "Jon",
  email: "jon_snow@thewall.we"
}
```

What happens when we want to iterate over a multidimensional hash like the one
below? Let's iterate over our nested hash one level at a time; iterating over
the first level of our hash would look like this:

```ruby
contacts = {
  "Jon Snow" => {
    name: "Jon",
    email: "jon_snow@thewall.we",
    favorite_ice_cream_flavors: ["chocolate", "vanilla", "mint chip"],
    knows: nil
  },
  "Freddy Mercury" => {
    name: "Freddy",
    email: "freddy@mercury.com",
    favorite_ice_cream_flavors: ["strawberry", "cookie dough", "mint chip"]
  }
}

contacts.each do |person, data|
  puts "#{person}: #{data}"
end
```

This should return:

```txt
Jon Snow:
{ :name=>"Jon",
  :email=>"jon_snow@thewall.we",
  :favorite_ice_cream_flavors=>["chocolate", "vanilla", "mint chip"],
  :knows=>nil
}

Freddy Mercury:
{ :name=>"Freddy",
:email=>"freddy@mercury.com",
:favorite_ice_cream_flavors=>["strawberry", "cookie dough", "mint chip"]
}
```

On the first level, the keys are our contacts' names, "Jon Snow" and "Freddy
Mercury", and our values are the hashes that contain a series of key/value pairs
describing them.

Let's iterate over the second level of our `contacts` hash. In order to access
the key/value pairs of the second tier (i.e. the name, email, and other data
about each contact), we need to iterate _down into_ that level. So, we pick up
where we left off with the previous iteration and we keep going:

```ruby
contacts.each do |person, data|
  #at this level, "person" is Jon Snow or Freddy Mercury and "data" is a hash of
  #key/value pairs to iterate over the "data" hash, we can use the following line:

  data.each do |attribute, value|
    puts "#{attribute}: #{value}"
  end
end
```

That should output the following:

```txt
name: Jon
email: jon_snow@thewall.we
favorite_ice_cream_flavors: ["chocolate", "vanilla", "mint chip"]
knows: nil

name: Freddy
email: freddy@mercury.com
favorite_ice_cream_flavors: ["strawberry", "cookie dough", "mint chip"]
```

Let's take it one step further and print out _just the favorite ice cream
flavors_. Once again, we'll need to iterate down into that level of the hash,
then we can access the favorite ice cream array and print out the flavors:

```ruby
contacts.each do |person, data|
  #at this level, "person" is Jon Snow or Freddy and "data" is a hash of
  #key/value pairs to iterate over the "data" hash, we can use the following
  #line:

  data.each do |attribute, value|
    #at this level, "attribute" describes the key of :name, :email,
    #:favorite_ice_cream_flavors, or :knows we need to first check and see if
    #the key is :favorite_ice_cream_flavors, if it is, that means the VALUE is
    #an array that we can iterate over to print out each element

    if attribute == :favorite_ice_cream_flavors
      value.each do |flavor|
        # here, each index element in an ice cream flavor string
        puts "#{flavor}"
      end
    end
  end
end
```

This should output:

```txt
chocolate
vanilla
mint chip
strawberry
cookie dough
mint chip
```
